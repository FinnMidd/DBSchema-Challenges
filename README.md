## Challenges

Explore the `Challenges` directory to find unique scenarios that require designing database schemas. Each challenge comes with a detailed description in the `scenario.md` file within its respective directory.

## Solutions

Discover proposed solutions to challenges in the `Solutions` directory. Solutions are provided in the form of markdown files (`solution.md`) to help you compare your approach with others.

In addition, the `Solutions` directory contains SQL scripts (`schema.sql`) that you can use to create the initial database schema for each challenge. These scripts serve as a starting point for implementing the challenges on your database system of choice.
