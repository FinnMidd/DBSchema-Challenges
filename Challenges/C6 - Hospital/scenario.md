# Challenge: Hospital Management System

## Scenario

You have been tasked with designing a database for a Hospital Management System. This system is crucial for efficiently managing patient records, medical staff, appointments, and various healthcare-related operations. Your goal is to create a robust database schema that supports the specific needs of the hospital.

## Requirements

1. **Patients:**
   - Each patient has a unique patient ID and personal details, including name, date of birth, gender, and contact information.
   - Record information about medical history, allergies, and existing conditions.

2. **Medical Staff:**
   - Medical staff includes doctors, nurses, and administrative personnel.
   - Each staff member is identified by a unique staff ID.
   - Collect information such as name, specialization, contact details, and shift schedule.

3. **Appointments:**
   - Appointments include details like date, time, patient ID, and staff ID (doctor).
   - Track appointment status (scheduled, completed, canceled).
   - Record details of each patient's diagnosis, prescribed medications, and treatment plans.
   - Associate medical records with the corresponding patient and staff IDs.

5. **Wards and Rooms:**
   - Wards are identified by a unique ward number.
   - Each room within a ward has a room number and occupancy status.
   - Track patient admissions, discharges, and room assignments.

## Tasks

1. Design the database schema to represent the entities and relationships described in the requirements.
2. Include primary and foreign key constraints where necessary.
3. Consider any additional attributes or constraints that would enhance the functionality of the Hospital Management System.

## Notes

- You can choose any relational database management system (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) for implementing your database schema.
- Feel free to provide a brief explanation of your design decisions in the `notes.md` file.

Happy designing!
