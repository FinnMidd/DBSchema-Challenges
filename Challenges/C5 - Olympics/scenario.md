## Scenario

You have been selected to design a database for an Olympic Events Management System. This system is intended to streamline the organization and tracking of events during the Olympic Games. Your task is to create a database schema that supports the scheduling, participant management, and results tracking for various Olympic events.

## Requirements

1. **Events:**
   - Each event is uniquely identified and categorized by sport (e.g., swimming, athletics, gymnastics).
   - Events have specific details such as date, time, venue, and any additional requirements.

2. **Sports:**
   - Sports are categorized and include information such as name, rules, and any specific equipment or facilities required.

3. **Participants:**
   - Athletes and teams are registered as participants in events.
   - Collect information about each participant, including their name, nationality, and event-specific details.

4. **Results:**
   - Record the results of each event, including the performance of participants and relevant statistics (e.g., scores, timings).

5. **Venues:**
   - Venues are identified by a unique venue ID.
   - Include details about each venue, such as name, location, and capacity.

## Tasks

1. Design the database schema to represent the entities and relationships described in the requirements.
2. Include primary and foreign key constraints where necessary.
3. Consider any additional attributes or constraints that would enhance the functionality of the Olympic Events Management System.

## Notes

- You can choose any relational database management system (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) for implementing your database schema.
- Feel free to provide a brief explanation of your design decisions in the `notes.md` file.

Happy designing!
