# Challenge: Military Bomb Squad Inventory Management System

## Scenario

You are tasked with designing a database for a Military Bomb Squad Inventory Management System. This system is crucial for efficiently managing equipment, tracking inventory, and ensuring the safety of bomb squad personnel. Your goal is to create a robust database schema that supports the specific needs of the bomb squad.

## Requirements

1. **Equipment:**
   - Each piece of equipment has a unique identifier, name, description, and condition status (e.g., serviceable, unserviceable, in maintenance).
   - Equipment may include bomb disposal robots, protective gear, detection devices, and specialized tools.

2. **Personnel:**
   - Bomb squad personnel are identified by a unique personnel ID.
   - Collect information about each team member, including their name, rank, certification level, and contact details.

3. **Training Records:**
   - Keep track of the training records for bomb squad personnel.
   - Record the type of training, date completed, and any certifications obtained.

4. **Incident Reports:**
   - Document incidents and responses by the bomb squad.
   - Include details such as date, location, type of incident, and equipment used.

5. **Inventory Transactions:**
   - Record the movement of equipment, including acquisitions, disposals, and maintenance activities.

## Tasks

1. Design the database schema to represent the entities and relationships described in the requirements.
2. Include primary and foreign key constraints where necessary.
3. Consider any additional attributes or constraints that would enhance the functionality of the Military Bomb Squad Inventory Management System.

## Notes

- You can choose any relational database management system (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) for implementing your database schema.
- Feel free to provide a brief explanation of your design decisions in the `notes.md` file.

Happy designing!
